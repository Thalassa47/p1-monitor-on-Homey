Iâ€™ve a SolarEdge converter connected with the solar panels and a smart grid meter.
Homey get the smart meter data via P1 monitor and the solar data via the Zonnepanelen app with data imported via the SolarEdge API key.

In the overview Homey makes in my opinion the wrong calculation.
Homey adds up the solar energy and the energy supplied!
